# 100 Days of Code in Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Journey! Over the next 100 days, I'll be challenging myself to learn and grow my Python skills by working on a diverse set of projects ranging from simple scripts to complex applications. Each day, I'll add new projects and document my progress and learnings.

## About The Challenge

The 100 Days of Code is a challenge designed to help you become a better programmer. It involves coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. I've chosen Python because of its versatility and powerful ecosystem.

## Goals

- **Improve proficiency in Python:** By coding every day, I aim to enhance my understanding and skills in Python.
- **Build a variety of Python projects:** Each project will focus on different applications of Python, from web development with Django to data analysis with Pandas.
- **Document the learning process:** Share insights and challenges faced to help others learn from my experience.

## Project Index

Here's a list of projects I plan to work on. This index will be updated regularly with links to the projects and brief descriptions:

| Day | Project | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1   | [Band Name Generator] | This app randomly generates band names using some specified logic. |
| 2   | [BMI Calculator]) | Calculates BMI after taking input for height and weight. |
| 3   | [Tip Calculator]) | Calculates tip after taking input for percentage of tip to give, total bill and total number of persons. |
| ... | ...     | ...         |
| 100 | [Project Name](Link-to-project) | Brief description of the project. |

## How to Use This Repository

- **Navigate the Repository:** Each file is named after a project thats done per day and contains all the src for that day's project.
- **Running the Projects:** Instructions for running each project can be found within the respective project folder, usually in a file named `README.md` specific to that project.(coming soon for more robust projects)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x:** Main programming language used.
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** Details about any additional libraries or frameworks used would be added here...
